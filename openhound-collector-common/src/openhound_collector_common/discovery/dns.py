# Generalized from sccm/sccm/src/openhound_sccm/collectors/dns.py (the resolver
# override + SRV/A discovery helpers) and the Go reference
# MSSQLHound/cmd/mssqlhound/main.go (`--dc` auto-resolve: SRV `_ldap._tcp.<domain>`
# first, A-record of the domain as fallback) and MSSQLHound/internal/ad/client.go
# `resolveDomainController` / the `--dns-resolver` override in `NewClient`.
#
# "Generalize" per design spec §2.1: the SCCM collector only ever resolved
# management-point SRV records inline inside a dlt resource; here we lift the
# generic pieces (a configurable dnspython resolver + domain-controller
# discovery) into reusable functions with no SCCM/MSSQL specifics. The proxy-
# aware angle mirrors the Go `SetProxyDialer` rebuild that forces DNS over TCP
# through the SOCKS5 proxy, exposed here as an optional knob.
"""DNS-based discovery helpers for OpenHound collectors.

Two public pieces:

- :func:`resolve_dc` — find a domain controller hostname for a domain. If the
  caller already knows the DC it is returned unchanged; otherwise we ask DNS for
  the ``_ldap._tcp.<domain>`` SRV record (the canonical "where are my DCs" query
  every domain-joined machine uses) and fall back to the domain's own A record.
- :func:`make_resolver` — build a :class:`dns.resolver.Resolver` pointed at a
  specific nameserver IP, optionally forcing TCP (needed when the lookups are
  tunneled through a SOCKS5 proxy, which cannot carry UDP).

Uses ``dnspython``. Stdlib ``socket`` is used only for the final A-record
fallback so we get the host's effective resolver behavior for the plain case.
