# New module (no SCCM equivalent). Installs a process-wide SOCKS5 interception
# so every stdlib-socket-based client (ldap3, impacket, requests/urllib3,
# dnspython-over-TCP, raw probes) tunnels through the proxy with no per-call
# changes. Ports the INTENT of the Go MSSQLHound proxydialer, generalized from
# "one TDS dial" to "all in-process TCP", because the SCCM collector speaks five
# protocols across four libraries.
"""Process-wide SOCKS5 socket interception for OpenHound collectors.

`install(proxy)` swaps three things on the stdlib ``socket`` module:

- ``socket.socket``          -> :class:`_ProxiedSocket` (a subclass whose
  ``connect`` runs the SOCKS5 handshake to the destination).
- ``socket.create_connection`` -> :func:`create_connection` (passes the raw
  hostname to the proxy — never resolves a target name locally).
- ``socket.getaddrinfo``     -> :func:`getaddrinfo` (a pass-through that returns
  the hostname unresolved, so libraries that pre-resolve — e.g. urllib3 — hand
  the name to ``connect`` for socks5h resolution instead of failing on an
  internal-only name).

Loopback targets and the proxy endpoint itself are never proxied (recursion /
local-traffic guard). `uninstall()` restores the originals; prefer the
:func:`socks_proxy_installed` context manager so restore is guaranteed.

This is install-once-per-process: the collect pipeline already assumes a single
run per process. Not reentrant.
