# Generalized from sccm/sccm/src/openhound_sccm/transforms.py (helpers _safe,
# _ensure_columns, _arr only).
#
# "Generalize" per design spec §2.1: kept the generic DuckDB-defense logic;
# stripped the SCCM-specific bits:
#   - SCCM's _safe baked in a WMI-vs-AdminService "sibling table" downgrade (a
#     missing wmi_<x> is only a DEBUG miss when adminservice_<x> exists). That
#     transport-mirror knowledge is SCCM-specific, so here a missing table is a
#     plain WARNING by default and the sibling-downgrade is OPT-IN via an
#     injectable callback (expected_miss),
#   - renamed to public, collector-agnostic names: safe_execute / ensure_columns
#     / arr_sql.
#
# Why these exist (the dlt column-dropping gotcha, design spec §14.3): dlt drops
# columns that are absent or all-NULL across a load, and snake_cases camelCase
# keys. A coalesce SELECT that references such a column then fails to compile with
# a DuckDB BinderException and — if wrapped in safe_execute — silently drops the
# whole source. ensure_columns pre-creates the referenced-but-absent columns as
# typed NULLs so the SELECT always binds; arr_sql normalizes a list column to
# VARCHAR[] whatever physical shape dlt gave it.
"""DuckDB-safe SQL helpers: run-and-log, missing-column backfill, and list
normalization, hardening preproc SQL against dlt's column dropping/renaming.
