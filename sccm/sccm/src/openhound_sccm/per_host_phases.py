"""The ordered SCCM per-host phases and the tables they write.

For this framework build the phases point at stub collectors; each is replaced
by a real collector in its own follow-up ticket. Phase names double as the
``--collection-methods`` gating tokens (matching ConfigManBearPig.ps1's
``$script:PhasesPerHost``), so the engine's gate is simply
``ctx.method_enabled(phase.name)``.
